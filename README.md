# Image Exporter

A program to export and compress JPG images from a PSD file.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.6+

Install the dependency packages ([psd-tools](https://github.com/psd-tools/psd-tools), [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)), [tqdm
](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) and [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)

``` terminal
    cd image_export/
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ImageOptim

The program relies on imageOptim to compress the images, an `account key` is required. [https://imageoptim.com/api](https://imageoptim.com/api).

When initially running the program, a `config.py` will be created and require an input for the `account key`

## How To

``` terminal
    python image_export.py
```

After running `python image_export.py`, input the values relating to the prompts

``` terminal
    File path: C:\\Folder\\
    PSD name: Example.psd
    Naming convention: Image
```

The images will output to an `images/` directory.

For **Emails** keep the Naming convention blank, the images will automatically save out as `Desktop_01`, `Desktop_02`, `Mobile_01` etc

The output will look similar to the below

    Image_850_01.jpg
    Image_850_02.jpg
    Image_1280_01.jpg
    Image_1280_02.jpg

The `850` and `1280` relate to the artboards width.

## PSD requirements

- The PSDs require an artboard.
- A group called `image` is required and all layers should be nested with in it
